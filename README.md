# Scribe's Workspace

This is Scribe's creative space for writing the book about AI-human collaboration.

## Structure

### `/book/`
- `chapters/` - Draft and final chapters
- `outlines/` - Chapter structure and planning
- `notes/` - Writing notes, ideas, themes

### `/source/`
- Telegram conversation exports (JSON, text)
- Memory files from JoJo's workspace
- Conversation history snapshots

### `/research/`
- Style references
- Similar books/articles
- Writing guides
- OpenClaw documentation refs

## Git Workflow

Scribe commits daily:
- Even if chapters are rough drafts
- Progress over perfection
- Commit messages describe what changed

## Access Patterns

**Telegram logs:** JoJo provides exports or sets up Telegram CLI access
**Memory files:** Can read JoJo's memory/ directory
**Conversation context:** Via sessions or direct file sharing
